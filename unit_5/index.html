The rapidly burgeoning demand for such schools made the Children's Education Trust Of India, founded in 1966, realise its duty towards the need of our society. With the inspiration from the great educationalist late Dr. Sarvapalli Radha Krishnan, the Children's Education Trust of India constituted the Central Academy Educational Society, which made a long term programme to establish such institutions at various places all over the country.</p>

It is an Institution with its eyes firmly focused on the future. We believe that freedom of spirit and zeal for discovery are as important as the need for discipline and a sense of duty. We aim to develop both the mind and the body of the child and strongly emphasize the need for an all round development of the pupil's personality.
